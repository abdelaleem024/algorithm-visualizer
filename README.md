# Algorithm Visualizer

[![GitHub Pages Deployment](https://img.shields.io/github/deployments/yousfahmed/algorithm-visualizer/github-pages)](https://yousfahmed.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/)

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that demonstrates how various pathfinding algorithms work. This visualizer currently supports three algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), A\*, and Bi-directional Search. Additionally, it features a maze generator that creates random mazes for the algorithms to solve.

## Demo
